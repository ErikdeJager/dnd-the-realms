## Origin

A violent race of a half monster breed.
A male Vunin defeats an [Aberration](../Creature%20types/Aberration.md), [Beast](../Creature%20types/Beast.md) or [Monstrosity](../Creature%20types/Monstrosity.md) and brings it to a female Vunin as a trophy. If the female is satisfied with the trophy, the male Vunin fertilizes the female Vunin's eggs, the female lays her eggs inside the slain carcass.
The eggs hatch and start eating the carcass, growing in size rapidly. It takes on the traits of whatever creature it was hatched from but will always grow to have a [Humanoid](../Creature%20types/Humanoid.md) body.
Size differs based on the carcass it was eating, but can be anywhere from 2 to 7 feet tall

Female Vunin tend to prefer large and powerful trophies, a small Vunin is very rare.

## Culture

Vunin are a bloodthirsty and vicious species. The only way for them to reproduce is by slaying monsters, as a result the Vunin are not a common race to found in the realms. Cities and civilization tends to disregard them for their violent nature. Other cultures might reject them or see them as a nice "pest control".

Vunin tend to be loud and present, wanting to prove their strength or wit.
Vunin's class is often also determined by the carcass they were hatched in; A creature with great might will commonly result in the Vunin being a barbarian or fighter. Where if the creature has great intelligence it could become a wizard and act more civilized.
