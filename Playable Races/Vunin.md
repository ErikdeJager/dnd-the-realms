# Vunin

Vunin are born of blood and conquest — a brutal fusion of humanoid and monster. Their reproduction is as savage as their nature: a male Vunin must hunt and slay a powerful creature — an [aberration](../Creature%20types/Aberration.md), [beast](../Creature%20types/Beast.md), or [monstrosity](../Creature%20types/Monstrosity.md)
— and bring the carcass as a trophy to a female. If she deems the kill worthy, she allows him to fertilize her eggs, which she then lays within the corpse. There, the unborn Vunin feed upon the flesh of the slain creature, growing rapidly and inheriting fragments of its strength, instincts, or form. When they emerge, they do so from the torn remains of their first meal..

Their appearance varies wildly depending on the creature that nurtured them: One might be marked with scaled skin that glints like stone, another with too-sharp eyes that catch every flicker of motion, or with sinewy limbs built for speed and the hunt. But no matter their origin, all Vunin share a humanoid form.

Civilized societies often shun Vunin, branding them monsters or weapons to be used against greater threats. Yet even among themselves, Vunin have a rough sense of honor — respect for courage, defiance, and cleverness, no matter the form it takes. They are loud, proud, and relentless, ever seeking to prove that they are not mere beasts born from corpses — but the ultimate evolution of predator and man.
