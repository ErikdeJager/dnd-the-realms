# Once upon a time

There was a being of unknown origin — a sleeping creature that dreamed of a world.
A world strange, dangerous, yet beautiful.

If this mysterious being were ever to awaken and cease dreaming, it would mark the end of everything.

This creature’s name is [Anvea, The Dormant God](Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md)
.
From its slumber, Anvea dreams of the Six Realms, spreading through the depths of unconsciousness.
