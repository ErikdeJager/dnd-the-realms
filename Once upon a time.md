# Once upon a time

There was a being, its origin unknown. A sleeping creature with dreams of a world. A world strange, dangerous, yet beautiful.
If this strange sleeping creature was ever to wake up and stop dreaming. I'd be the end of everything.
This creatures name is [Anvea, The Dormant God](Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md), for it is the world itself.

It dreams of the six realms. spreading into nothingness of unconsciousness.
