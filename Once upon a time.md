# Once upon a time

There was a being of unknown origin — a sleeping creature that dreamed of a world.
A world strange, dangerous, yet beautiful.

If this mysterious being were ever to awaken and cease dreaming, it would mark the end of everything.

This creature’s name is [Anvea, The Dormant God](Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md)
.
From its slumber, Anvea dreams of the Six Realms, spreading through the depths of unconsciousness.

- [Abyra](Realms/Abyra.md) - the outer edge of Anvea's mind.
- [Deracha](Realms/Deracha.md) - the doubt of Anvea.
- [Eromorra](Realms/Eromorra.md) - the hope of Anvea.
- [Hailra](Realms/Hailra.md) - the emotion of Anvea.
- [Leda](Realms/Leda.md) - the memory of Anvea.
- [Aefir](Realms/Aefir.md) - the world of mortals.


After the world's creation, time marched onwards. \
