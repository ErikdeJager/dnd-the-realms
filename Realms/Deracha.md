# Deracha

This realm is effected by [The Homeward Veil](../Concepts/The%20Homeward%20Veil.md)

A realm of corrupted origin, born when [Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) first dreamed of doubt.

Deracha festers beneath the layers of the god’s slumber—a place where every shadow that has ever crossed the divine mind takes form. The land is alive, yet endlessly crying: forests that bleed sap like ichor, mountains that breathe, rivers that whisper the sins of those who drink from them. The air hums with a dissonant pulse, a heartbeat that is not one’s own.

Here dwell the Remnants of Regret, beings birthed from the god’s moments of unease, each one reflecting an emotion that Anvea once wished to unmake—envy, hunger, fear, pride. They are not evil by design but by despair, twisting toward cruelty in their yearning to feel anything real.

When [The Circle](../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) passes through Deracha, its spirit waves are tainted with shadowed will. Mortals born under such influence may carry deep ambition, cunning, or obsession—the drive to control what cannot be controlled. Yet some emerge stronger for it, wielding their inner corruption like tempered steel.

Deracha is the wound beneath creation, a reminder that even gods can dream of failure.
