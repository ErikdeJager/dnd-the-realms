This realm is effected by [[The Homeward Veil]]

A realm where direction is meaningless—up can be down, north is south, and every path leads everywhere at once. Those who seek a way through are quickly lost, yet those who surrender their search often stumble upon exactly what they need.

Floating islands drift above an endless void. To fall is not to die, but to loop endlessly—dropping into the nothingness only to emerge again from the skies above. Sometimes gravity itself turns traitor, hurling wanderers upward instead of down. Each island is its own world: lush jungles, barren deserts, frozen wastes, or landscapes stranger still, appearing and vanishing without warning.

Time here is twisted. An hour in Leda is but a minute in Terra, and the creatures that call it home all share one gift—wings, or some other means of flight—for without it, survival is fleeting.

Legends whisper that when [[The Circle]] and [[The Storm]] were born, their first breath stirred in the shifting skies of Leda.
