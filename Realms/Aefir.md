# Aefir

The world of mortals.

When [Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) dreamed deeply enough to give thought shape and soul breath, Aefir was born. It is the place where the god’s imagination becomes matter—where the tides of [The Circle](../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) crash into the veil and incarnate as living beings.

Here, dreams take root in soil, and emotion becomes rain, mountain, and flame. The skies of Aefir echo faintly with the hum of [The Circle's](../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) passage, an endless pulse that breathes life into stone and flesh alike. Mortals are not mere creations—they are resonances, the fleeting physical notes of an eternal song.

Each mortal soul bears the faint imprint of the realms that shaped its spirit before birth:

- From [Hailra](Hailra.md), passion and fear.
- From [Leda](Leda.md), curiosity and memory.
- From [Deracha](Deracha.md), will and corruption.
- From [Eromorra](Eromorra.md), hope and faith.

Yet in Aefir, these traits are no longer bound to divine mood—they become choice. For the first time in the god’s dream, thought may turn against its origin. Mortals may love in the shadow of despair, create in the midst of ruin, or defy even the rules of their making.

It is said that Anvea’s subconscious watches them through shifting skies and tides, drawn to their unpredictability. Some claim that each mortal act of kindness steadies the god’s slumber, while each act of cruelty stirs a flicker of wakefulness.

Aefir is a paradox—a stable realm in an unstable dream. The gods do not belong here; their presence bends the fabric of existence. But mortals do. Gods cannot endure here without losing themselves due to the [Rules of the Dream](../Concepts/Rules%20of%20the%20Dream.md). That is why the gods send their avatars to Aefir instead

Many scholars believe Aefir exists to keep Anvea dreaming—a balance between chaos and order, hope and despair, ensuring the god never fully awakens nor falls into endless sleep. To live here is to sustain the dream itself.

And so the world of Aefir spins within the veil, surrounded by the higher realms and encircled by the endless dark of [Abyra](Abyra.md)—the heartbeat of creation echoing softly in the silence of the sleeping god.
