# Eromorra

This realm is effected by [The Homeward Veil](../Concepts/The%20Homeward%20Veil.md)

A realm of pure origin, where [Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) dreams of perfection—and forgets imperfection exists.

Eromorra shines as a vast horizon of light and resonance, where form and sound are one. Mountains sing, oceans pulse with luminous rhythm, and beings of radiant design drift between them, each carrying a note in the god’s endless melody. There is no true night here, only gentle dimness when the god exhales.

This is not a paradise as mortals understand it, for its harmony is absolute—unyielding, without flaw or freedom. To dwell here too long is to lose individuality, dissolving into the will of the Dream itself. Those who remain become the Serene Host, beings who embody purpose so completely that doubt and choice vanish from their essence.

When [The Circle](../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) passes through Eromorra, the spirits it touches awaken with clarity, compassion, or fierce resolve. Yet some are cursed by its perfection—striving their whole lives for an impossible ideal that drives them to sorrow.

Eromorra is the breath of creation unspoiled, the dream of what Anvea wishes all could be—if only the god could wake without destroying it.
