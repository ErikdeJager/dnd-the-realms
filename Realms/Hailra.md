# Hailra

This realm is effected by [The Homeward Veil](../Concepts/The%20Homeward%20Veil.md)

Hailra shifts as [Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) dreams. At times, it stretches as an endless sea of sapphire water, calm and shallow, beneath skies of impossible beauty. Strange radiant beings drift across its surface to greet wanderers, speaking in voices like half-remembered songs. But the serenity is never to be trusted—it is only the mood of the dormant god, and moods always turn.

When unease stirs in the sleeper’s mind, the waters blacken. The sky folds into shadow. What was once light becomes an abyss without horizon, and in it, vast eyes blink open. They fix on travelers without mercy. Some whisper secrets that corrode thought, others scream until the air quakes, and others only watch in silence, unblinking, until those under their gaze forget what they are.

Wander too long, and the dream consumes more than the body—thoughts, memories, even the self unravel into the tides of [Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md)’s restless spirit. This realm is everchanging for it is the emotion and subconsciousness of [Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md). To step into Hailra is to trespass in the mind of a god.

When waves of [The Circle](../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) pass through this realm before mortals are born with its spirit energy, those waves may take on unique character traits depending on the god's mood, emotion and subconsciousness. The mortal spirit may become easily frightened, or mentally steadfast as a mountain. Though generally the other realms are more influential on mortal spirits.
