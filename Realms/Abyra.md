# Abyra

The edge of everything. The silence beyond the dream.

Here the dream of [Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) thins into nothingness, and what remains is Abyra—an endless, unlit gulf where form and thought unravel. Beyond it lies no further truth, no other world. Only the absence of dreaming.

Some say Abyra is the boundary of the god’s mind, the final breath before awakening. Others claim it is the graveyard of forgotten thoughts—everything Anvea has dreamed and then erased. The gods themselves dare not touch it, for even their essence can dissolve within its stillness.

Things cast into Abyra do not die; they are unwritten. What remains of them drifts as pale echoes, mindless and eternal, haunting the edges of the dream.

To cross Abyra is to reach the end of all being—and to glimpse, for an instant, what lies beyond the god’s sleep.
