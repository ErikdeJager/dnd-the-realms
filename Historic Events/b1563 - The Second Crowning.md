# The Second Crowning

"You who call yourselves wise have drenched the realms in blood. You have torn the seas, broken the mountains, and buried mortals beneath your quarrelsâ€”all for greed, all for power, all for a crown you do not deserve, nor could claim.

You call mortals pawns, yet it is they who have turned the tide when gods faltered. It was [Yik of clan I'ness.md](../Characters%20of%20Interest/Yik%20of%20clan%20I%27ness.md), mortal-born, who defied the rot. It was Ridis, of flesh and will alone, who ended your endless war. In every hour of true need, it has been mortals who bore the weight you could not. That is your blindness. That is your downfall.

I am [Misle, The King of Gods.md](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Misle%2C%20The%20King%20of%20Gods.md). I did not win this throne with storm or fire, but with trust freely given by one mortal hand. And by that trust I swear this: I will guard mortality. I will see [Terra.md](../Realms/Terra.md) prosper, and its children live by their own will, not as playthings of the divine.

The age of rot is ended. The age of mortals begins."
