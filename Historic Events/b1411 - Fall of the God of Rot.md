# Fall of the God of Rot

For five centuries, [Yik of clan I'ness](../Characters%20of%20Interest/Yik%20of%20clan%20I%27ness.md) had endured. At five hundred and nine years of age, he was no longer the strange young Vunin who had once listened to whispers in the dark, but a figure of quiet gravity and unstoppable will. His body bore the scars of time, yet his mind still burned with an unquenchable fire. The whispers that had once guided him were long outpaced; he had surpassed their knowledge centuries ago, pushing further into the forbidden corners of magic than any mortal had dared. What remained of his life was bound to a single purpose: to free the world from [Erdilluth, God of Rot](../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Erdilluth%2C%20God%20of%20Rot.md) once and for all.

The city of [Aegis](../Places%20of%20Interest/Aegis.md), which he had founded with the blessing of the [Aegis of Mortals](../Concepts/Aegis%20of%20Mortals.md), was the heart of his triumph. Where once the world had withered, within its walls more than three hundred and thirty-four thousand souls thrived. Children laughed in the streets, artisans forged wonders, merchants called out their wares, and scholars debated beneath towers of polished stone. Aegis was hope given form, the one city where life could bloom untouched by rot. To its people, Yik was savior, guardian, and sometimes even whispered of as a god himself. Yet in his heart, guilt gnawed at him.

For Aegis has hidden a terrible secret within its very streets. A weapon he named [Xiphos](../Concepts/Xiphos.md). It was no weapon a man could carry; it was vast and all-encompassing, woven into the city itself. The streets were its veins, the towers its spines, the hidden sigils beneath its foundations the coils of its heart. To those who lived above, it was a city. To Yik, it was a sword.

Centuries of study had taught him truths that gods would have destroyed him to conceal. He mapped the lattice of divine essence, and traced the laws that bound immortality itself. In the end, he discovered the unthinkable: how a god might be slain. [Xiphos](../Concepts/Xiphos.md) was the culmination of this knowledge, the first and only god-killing weapon forged by mortal hands. Yet it came at a cost so great it hollowed him to his soul. To awaken Xiphos required sacrifice—not a handful of lives, but a tide of them. Between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand mortal souls would be stripped from their flesh and poured into the weapon’s core, transmuted into the raw fire of divinity-killing force.

Yik carried that truth in silence. He had built a haven to save mortals, only to prepare it as a slaughterhouse for the very people who trusted him most. The paradox crushed him, but he never faltered. Erdilluth’s reign had to end, no matter the price. Still, he could not live with the thought of surviving while those he betrayed perished. And so, in the final days before activation, Yik made his decision. He would not stand apart. He would remain in Aegis, and he would give his own life to the weapon he had built. His soul would be one of those consumed by Xiphos.

When the appointed day arrived, the sky above Aegis was heavy with storm-colored clouds. The air grew heavy, vibrating with a sound that seemed to tremble in the bones rather than the ears. At first, the people merely looked skyward in confusion, but soon unease turned to terror. The ground shuddered, and the city seemed to hum like a plucked string. Then, without warning, the sacrifice began.

In an instant, tens of thousands vanished. They were not burned, nor broken, nor torn apart—they were simply gone. A mother reaching for her child, a soldier standing his watch, an old man dozing at his stall—all extinguished like candles in a sudden wind. Their essence was drawn into the hidden core of the city, and Xiphos awoke.

Azure light spread through the veins of Aegis, glowing in cracks between stones, in carvings long unnoticed, in windows and arches and walls. Sparks of blue drifted upward into the sky, and as the heavens split open, the stars themselves seemed to peel away. Beyond them, vast and dreadful, appeared the face of [Erdilluth, God of Rot](../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Erdilluth%2C%20God%20of%20Rot.md).

Xiphos roared.

From the center of Aegis, a pillar of searing light erupted, tearing the sky wide as thunder like the breaking of worlds shook the land. Chains of radiant energy lashed outward, seizing Erdilluth, dragging his immense and decayed form downward into the weapon’s grasp. The god bellowed, his voice a wave that shook mountains and churned seas, but he could not break free. Bound fast, he was forced into the path of the beam.

The blade of Xiphos struck true. The energy was not mere fire or lightning but the unraveling of essence itself, a torrent of annihilation that pierced through Erdilluth’s divine form. His body twisted, shattered, and collapsed upon itself as the beam hurled his remains screaming into [Abyra](../Realms/Abyra.md), the realm where even gods are stripped of power and denied rebirth.

The world shook with his death. The rot recoiled, retreating from soil and stone as if fleeing a cleansing flame. The curse that had plagued Aefir all this time dissolved into silence. And as Erdilluth’s final scream faded, the heavens convulsed. From his broken corpse tumbled [The Aethern Crown](../Concepts/The%20Aethern%20Crown.md), loosed from his dominion, and with it the promise—and the threat—of war among the gods.

Close to when he fell, Erdilluth’s head cast off the shining [Aegis of Mortals](../Concepts/Aegis%20of%20Mortals.md), which plummeted like a comet and struck the world below, its light scattering like shards of stars across the earth.

Yik did not live to see the Crown fall or the Aegis descend. His life, like those of his people, had been given to Xiphos. He perished within the weapon’s awakening, a savior, a traitor, and a martyr all at once. His city was gone, its streets silent, its people reduced to essence. But Erdilluth was dead, and the world was free.

And though the gods schemed in the wake of the fallen crown, far below in the shadow of ruins, the survivors of Aegis gathered their grief, took up stone and timber, and began to rebuild.
