# The First God War

As the gods opened their eyes, knowledge of [The Aethern Crown](../../Concepts/The%20Aethern%20Crown.md) flooded into their minds and few ignored its cries.
The first god war broke free, all realms were engulfed in its grasp. The gods created more mortal races to aid in their battles. Using humans and mixed that what was with that of the realms.

Unlike, what was first a contest of strength, now the war became somewhat unpredictable, for the mortals had true choice and free will according to the [Rules of the Dream](../../Concepts/Rules%20of%20the%20Dream.md).
Not all mortals supported their god, some mortals didn't even participate in the war.

Most of what happened during this war was lost. But eventually [Erdilluth, God of Rot](../../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Erdilluth,%20God%20of%20Rot.md) won the war. And became the first God King. The first act of [Erdilluth](../../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Erdilluth,%20God%20of%20Rot.md), was to curse the memories of this war to rot over time, even the gods would forget. This is why it has been lost to history what god created certain races, or how exactly the war was won.

This war lasted a total of 1639 years.
