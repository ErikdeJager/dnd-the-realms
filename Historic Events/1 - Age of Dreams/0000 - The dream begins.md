# The dream begins

The great sleeping god, [Anvea, The Dormant God](../../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea,%20The%20Dormant%20God.md). Closed its consciousness from its place of origin. It entered a deep slumber and begun a dream.
Its dream ravaged through its mind, creating the six realms and the gods. \
