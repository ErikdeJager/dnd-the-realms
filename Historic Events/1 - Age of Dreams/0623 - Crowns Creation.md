# Crowns Creation

[Anvea, The Dormant God](../../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md), had grown weary of godhood. The weight of duty pressed too heavily upon him, and the endless clamor of divine purpose no longer stirred his heart. He longed only to drift — to be free, untethered, a silent witness to all creation. To simply be.

In his yearning for release, [Anvea](../../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) shaped a relic unlike any other: [The Aethern Crown](../../Concepts/The%20Aethern%20Crown.md) — a marvel of boundless magic, gleaming with the power to make its bearer the supreme god above all others. The one true King of the Gods.

But in the moment of its creation, balance shattered. No god yet wore the crown, yet all desired it. Pride clashed with destiny, and what began as envy kindled into war.
