# Circle Sacrifice

[Mortals](../../Concepts/Mortals.md) could not escape the slow decay of [Erdilluth, God of Rot](../../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Erdilluth%2C%20God%20of%20Rot.md). In their desperation to endure the withering of flesh and spirit, they sought to surpass mortality itself. To leave behind the confines of death, rise beyond [The Homeward Veil](../../Concepts/The%20Homeward%20Veil.md) and leave [Aefir](../../Realms/Aefir.md), they needed only to amass an immense well of magic.

Those who succeeded in this ascension were known as the [Everborn](../../Concepts/Everborn.md)
— mortals who defied the end and became immortal.

But in doing so, the [Everborn](../../Concepts/Everborn.md) defied the will of [Zoses, Goddess of the Circle](../../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Zoses%2C%20Goddess%20of%20the%20Circle.md). Each soul that escaped [The Circle](../../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) permanently diminished its power and stole from the divine harmony that bound life and rebirth together.

Fury consumed [Zoses](../../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Zoses%2C%20Goddess%20of%20the%20Circle.md). The mortals’ defiance was an affront she could not forgive. To restore balance, she poured her very essence into the fabric of reality, reshaping the [Rules of the Dream](../../Concepts/Rules%20of%20the%20Dream.md). With her final breath, she wove a new rule:

> “Mortals must meet [the circle](../../Concepts/The%20Circle.md).”

Her sacrifice did not go unnoticed. [Anvea, The Dormant God](../../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md), sensing the shifting tides of creation, stirred for the first time in since [the crown's](../../Concepts/The%20Aethern%20Crown.md) creation. In response, [Anvea](../../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) added another unbreakable law:

> “None shall ever alter the [Rules of the Dream](../../Concepts/Rules%20of%20the%20Dream.md).”

Thus, [Zoses](../../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Zoses%2C%20Goddess%20of%20the%20Circle.md) perished, her essence forever entwined with the reborn [circle](../../Concepts/The%20Circle.md). Through her death, [the circle](../../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) became self-sustaining — a divine engine of magic and spirit, eternally turning without the need for gods or guardians.

Yet remnants of defiance remain. Some [Everborn](../../Concepts/Everborn.md) endure still, untouched by her final law — mortals who transcended before the sacrifice. But for all others, true immortality is lost. Mortals may lengthen their years or conjure spells to hold back age, but in the end, death always claims its due.
