# Crowns Creation

[Anvea, The Dormant God](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) grew tired of godhood and wanted to feel freedom and levitate. He wanted nothing but to spectate and be present in all things, but without the need to act. He created [The Aethern Crown](../Concepts/The%20Aethern%20Crown.md). A magical crown artifact that would make any god that wears it, the supreme god above all. Known as the King of the Gods.
At this time, none of the gods were crowned and this issued [a623.2 - The First God War](a623.2%20-%20The%20First%20God%20War.md).
