# Creation of the Aegis of Mortals

Dire circumstances. For over two thousand years, [Erdilluth, God of Rot.md](../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Erdilluth%2C%20God%20of%20Rot.md), has reigned unchallenged, bringing decay to every corner of the world. Under his shadow, the lands withered, and mortals found no escape from suffering. Even immortality was denied them—sacrificed by [Zoses, Goddess of the Circle.md](../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Zoses%2C%20Goddess%20of%20the%20Circle.md), who bound mortals to never ascend.

Yet the gods underestimated the resilience of mortals.

Among the [Vunin.md](../Playable%20Races/Vunin.md)—a brutal and savage race, hardened by the poisoned lands of rot—there arose a wizard unlike any other. Born from the carcass of a [Tallecnii.md](../Monsters/Tallecnii.md), he was called [Yik of clan I'ness.md](../Characters%20of%20Interest/Yik%20of%20clan%20I%27ness.md).

At first, Yik was an outcast. The Vunin prized strength and ferocity, while Yik’s sharp mind and curious nature set him apart. But his insight proved invaluable: he solved problems his clan faced not with brute force, but with insight and cunning. Over time, his leaders took notice.

In secret, Yik studied the arts of magic. He had no master, no scrolls, no tomes. His knowledge came from whispers—unseen voices that drifted into his mind, perhaps from a god?

By the year 4640, Yik’s power had grown immense. He had learned to prolong his life and to craft artifacts of wondrous strength. Guided by the whispers, he embarked on his greatest work so far. The undertaking consumed countless resources, but the result was worth every sacrifice: the [Aegis of Mortals.md](../Concepts/Aegis%20of%20Mortals.md).

With this artifact, Yik raised a shield against the rot. Where the Aegis shone, the land flourished. And upon this blessed ground, he founded the first great city of the age: [Aegis.md](../Places%20of%20Interest/Aegis.md).

People from across the dying world flocked to its gates. The city offered not only safety but hope—a promise of life amidst decay.

But outside the realm of [Terra.md](../Realms/Terra.md), Erdilluth watched with hatred, and the God of Rot stirred.
