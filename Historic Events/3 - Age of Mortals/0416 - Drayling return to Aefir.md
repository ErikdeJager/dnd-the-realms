# Drayling return to Aefir

As the newly created [Drayling](../../Playable%20Races/Drayling.md) revolted, the citadel of [Lassurus](../../Characters%20of%20Interest/Lassurus.md) was destroyed and crashed to the soils of [Deracha](../../Realms/Deracha.md).

With the citadel destroyed [The Homeward Veil](../../Concepts/The%20Homeward%20Veil.md) took effect and the [Drayling](../../Playable%20Races/Drayling.md) started to return to [Aefir](../../Realms/Aefir.md). The world of Aefir was socked by the sudden appearance of the new mortal race. In the modern day, [Drayling](../../Playable%20Races/Drayling.md) are just as common as the other races.
