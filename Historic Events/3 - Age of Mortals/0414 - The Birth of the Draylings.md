# The Birth of the Draylings

Through cracks in Aefir, [Lassurus](../../Characters%20of%20Interest/Lassurus.md) took mortals from their world — scholars, warriors, entire villages — and dragged them into the shadows of [Deracha](../../Realms/Deracha.md).

In the heart of this nightmare, [Lassurus](../../Characters%20of%20Interest/Lassurus.md) built his laboratory: a citadel grown from living stone and veins of silver, pulsing like an organ. There, he sought to force mortality and Derachan essence into harmony — to make the living endure beyond their Circle. With the power of this citadel, [Lassurus](../../Characters%20of%20Interest/Lassurus.md) could even fight against [The Homeward Veil](../../Concepts/The%20Homeward%20Veil.md)

His methods were precise, cruel, and endlessly repeated.

The early attempts were ruinous. Mortals melted into the ground or screamed until their voices became rivers. But Lassurus learned — adjusting the ratio of ichor to soul-flame, weaving runes through living veins, bending will into form. and after years, finally, one survived. She called herself Miren, though her body was no longer hers. Her flesh shimmered with Deracha’s pulse; her eyes bled faint light. Horns formed on top of her head. She was the first [Drayling](../../Playable%20Races/Drayling.md).

More survived after her. Dozens. Hundreds. None the same. But they were still mortal, still doomed to die and meet the circle.

The mortals captured by [Lassurus](../../Characters%20of%20Interest/Lassurus.md) broke free and [started a revolution.](0416%20-%20Fall%20of%20the%20Citadel.md)
