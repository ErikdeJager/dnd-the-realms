# Changing times

During the first two hundred years of God-King [Misle's'](../../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Misle%2C%20The%20King%20of%20Gods.md) rule a lot had changed.

- The world of [Aefir](../../Realms/Aefir.md) flourishes. Nature is ever present.
- [Mortals](../../Concepts/Mortals.md) are more present then ever. The favorable conditions of the world caused mortals to reproduce a lot.
- Vunin presence is being suffocated by other mortal races. There used to be more Vunin because of the harsh conditions under the rule of rot, but now they are quite rare (though they wont go extinct, dont worry).
