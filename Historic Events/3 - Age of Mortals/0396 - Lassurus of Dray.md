# Lassurus of Dray

[Lassurus](../../Characters%20of%20Interest/Lassurus.md) was a Dray — a being of [Deracha](../../Realms/Deracha.md), born of a god’s unease and tempered by the corruption that saturates that realm. Unlike most of his kind, he possessed something rare among immortals: curiosity.

He had seen uncounted cycles of [the circle](../../Concepts/The%20Circle.md), watched gods perish and [the rules of the dream](../../Concepts/Rules%20of%20the%20Dream.md) become immutable beneath [Anvea's](../../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Anvea%2C%20The%20Dormant%20God.md) decree. Yet the question burned within him: Could the rules be broken?

The Rule of [Zoses](../../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Zoses%2C%20Goddess%20of%20the%20Circle.md), that “Mortals must meet the circle,” sealed all mortal fates. None could ascend beyond death as the [Everborn](../../Concepts/Everborn.md) once had. But [Lassurus](../../Characters%20of%20Interest/Lassurus.md) believed laws were only boundaries waiting to be tested.

[He resolved to prove it.](0401%20-%20The%20Theft%20of%20Mortals.md)
