When **[[Erdilluth, God of Rot]]** was slain by the awakening of **[[Xiphos]]**, the heavens trembled. For the first time in memory, a god had fallen utterly, cast into **[[Abyra]]** where even divinity could not rise again. His dominion unraveled, and the balance of the divine collapsed into silence. From his ruin fell the relic of rule, the crown of dominion: **[[The Aethern Crown]]**. It struck the soil of **[[Terra]]** like a comet, its radiance searing the land where it came to rest. The gods raged. They coveted. They dreamed of sovereignty. For whoever claimed the Crown would rule all.

But the divine were bound, their essence chained beyond Terra’s veil. None could stride its soil in their true form. They sent their avatars instead: vessels of flesh and will, mortal frames infused with divine essence. These avatars descended in splendor and horror, carrying their patrons’ power into the world of mortals. War ignited once more.

The five realms groaned under its weight. Terra burned, rivers boiled, mountains split, and the bones of the fallen spread like dust upon the winds. Avatars clashed upon the mortal fields, each strike echoing with the wrath of their god. Yet though champions fell in droves, the war never ended. For when one avatar was slain, its god would breathe another into being, sending it forth to renew the struggle.

Among the gods, none was more feared than **[[Irra, Goddess of the Storm]]**, whose avatar bathed in magic, every step heralded by lightning. She sought the Crown not to rule alone, but to ascend beyond even divinity—to become something no storm could disperse, something eternal. Her rivals answered in kind, sending avatars of fire, shadow, and bone, each bent upon dominion.

And so the war dragged on, each dawn seeing the rebirth of champions, each dusk falling beneath ash and screams. Mortals fought and died by the thousands, not as pawns but as soldiers, rebels, and dreamers—choosing freely whether to stand beside the gods, against them, or apart altogether.

In this chaos, one god did not summon an avatar at all. The **God of Character**, little known and often overlooked, chose another path. Where others roared, he listened. He read the words mortals carved in poems, in prayers, in final breath: the longing, the grief, the fragile joys. From these he saw a truth no other god would admit. Mortals were not vessels to be filled with divine essence. They were not tools. They were the answer.

And so he whispered to not to an avatar, but to a mortal woman. Just like how he whispered to [[Yik of clan I'ness]].

Her name was **Ridis**. She had walked the scarred battlefields of Terra, seen cities crumble, and still raised her blade against despair. Her heart was unyielding, her will unbroken. The God of Character did not demand her service—he offered her choice. Fight, not for him, but for mortals. Fight, not to claim the Crown, but to end the war. Ridis agreed.

One by one, she hunted the avatars. Against the fury of gods she stood unbent, carving through vessels with a will none could break. She crossed blades with champions of magic, fire, shadow, and bone, striking them down in turn. Each death echoed across the heavens as their divine patrons howled, for never before had a mortal undone what gods themselves had woven.

At last, when the fields were quiet, Ridis stood alone. Around her lay the ruin of avatars, their ichor seeping into Terra’s earth. Before her shimmered the **[[Aethern Crown]]**, heavy with unspent dominion, its light casting long shadows in the silence.

She could have taken it. She could have placed it upon her brow, become queen of gods, and reshaped the realms in her image. All the power of rule lay within her grasp. But Ridis turned away.

Instead, she placed the Crown at the feet of her patron—the quiet god who had trusted her choice when none else would.

And so the God of Character rose, no longer a whisper, but **the God-King of All Realms**. In gratitude, he lifted Ridis into divinity beside him. She, once mortal, now walked among the gods. Yet even in her ascension, she remained bound by the [[Rules of the Dream]]. One day, like all mortals, she must meet **[[The Circle]]**.

Thus ended the war. Not by divine decree, nor by unending slaughter, but by the choice of mortal heart.
