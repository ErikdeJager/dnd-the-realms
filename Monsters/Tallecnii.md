[Aberration](../Creature%20types/Aberration.md)

A creature of great intellect. Can enthrall creatures to its will and speak directly into your mind. It is a generally passive creature, not seeking out combat. Instead it hates existence and emotions. It is greatly depressed and sees its own intellect as a curse.
The creature is thin and very tall. its brain grows rapidly, if the scull is too small for its brain it will break and the brain continues to grow even outside its skull. They are very strong creatures but still surprisingly easy to kill due to them being incapacitated most of the time.
Generally these creatures can be found in moist caves with many mushrooms, they use these mushrooms to create potions and drugs, in order to forget.
