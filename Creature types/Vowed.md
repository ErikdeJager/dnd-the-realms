## Vowed

(Effected by Fey targeting)

Vowed are mysterious beings whose existence is shaped by belief rather than blood, spirit, or law. Unlike other entities that forge pacts with gods or mortals, a Vowed power stems from a contract of faith — an unbreakable conviction made with itself.

Each Vowed carries within it a binding truth or oath, a mental contract so absolute that it reshapes the creature’s body and soul. Through sheer will, a Vowed belief manifests as tangible power: strange magic, unnatural resilience, or, in rare cases, true immortality.

Should a Vowed break its mental contract, its power could wane, rob a Vowed of strength or destroy them entirely; body and spirit dissolving as their truth collapses.

> Example creatures: \
> **Devourer of Sighs** must consume the essence of three mortals each night to maintain its form. As long as it fulfills this grim covenant, no blade, spell, or divine word can end its life. But should a single night pass without feeding, its body crumbles into ash and silence.
>
> The **Star Watcher** believes it must never close its eyes while the stars shine. For centuries it has stood vigil through every night, its body frozen and awake. This creature will not age, but the moment it sleeps beneath starlight, it will instantly age a thousand years and die — for such is the promise it made to itself.
