Rules created by [[Anvea, The Dormant God]] in its dream. Fundamental law of all that is. These rules are impossible to be betrayed by any inside the dream.

These rules include but are not excluded to;

1. None can never change these rules.
2. None may time travel or reverse time.
3. Gods may never enter the realm [[Terra]] directly, they must use an avatar instead.
4. No realm may ever be truly destroyed and removed from existence. Destruction within the realm is accepted 
5. Mortals are not pawns; they have true choice and free will.
6. Mortals must meet [[The Circle]]
