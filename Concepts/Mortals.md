# Mortals

A **mortal** is any being of [Aefir](../Realms/Aefir.md) (or other finite existence) that:

- **Is born and dies** (has a finite lifespan).
- **Can be killed** permanently, unlike gods or certain outsiders.
- **Is not inherently divine** (though they might worship deities, wield divine power, or ascend to godhood).

Mortals are contrasted with:

- **Deities (gods, divine beings)** — who are immortal and beyond natural death.
- **[Dray](../Creature%20types/Dray.md), [Mero](../Creature%20types/Mero.md), [Lyks](../Creature%20types/Lyks.md), [Construct](../Creature%20types/Construct.md), [Aberration.md](../Creature%20types/Aberration.md), [Elemental.md](../Creature%20types/Elemental.md) and other eternal outsiders** — who may not age or die naturally, though they can often be destroyed or killed.
- [Undead](../Creature%20types/Undead.md) — who were once mortal but no longer follow the natural cycle of life and death.


In short: In this world, a **mortal** is any creature subject to **time, aging, and death**.
