# The Homeward Veil

Mortals cannot permanently stay in this realm. Every long rest they have to make a saving throw (ability chosen by character).

[DC (22 minus Character Level)]
The DC is increased by 1 for every consecutive long rest in this realm.

On a failed save, the character blinks back to the location from where they entered the realm.
