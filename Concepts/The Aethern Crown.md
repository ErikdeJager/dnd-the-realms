# The Aethern Crown

An all-powerful crown, the creature wearing this crown is considered the god king and has the most influence on the dream. The first wearer of the crown was [Erdilluth, God of Rot](../Gods/Fallen%20Gods/Erdilluth%2C%20God%20of%20Rot.md). The current king is [Misle](../Gods/Wondrous%20Gods/Misle%2C%20The%20King%20of%20Gods.md).

The crown is stuck to the head of the wearer until they die. If the wearer is a god, in most cases the wearer would be reincarnated after death but they would still lose the crown. However, the crown gives so much power that it is very rare to kill the wearer, even for gods.
