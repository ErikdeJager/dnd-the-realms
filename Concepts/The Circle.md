# The Circle

The circle contains "spirit energy", this energy roams the realms in a giant circle. 

The circle starts in [Leda](../Realms/Leda.md) and follows the realms counter-clockwise: [Eromorra](../Realms/Eromorra.md), [Deracha](../Realms/Deracha.md), [Hailra](../Realms/Hailra.md) and finally [Aefir](../Realms/Aefir.md) before heading back to [Leda](../Realms/Leda.md) once more.

The waves of the circle crash and fluctuate around the realms. The realms influence these waves and give the spirit energy unique character traits. Finally a wave will crash into [Aefir](../Realms/Aefir.md); giving souls to all mortals that are being born at that moment. All mortals have a soul that is shaped by the circle and the realms, granting unique character traits.

If we heavily summarize the character traits these realms could possible give to the circle, we can list them like this:

- From [Hailra](../Realms/Hailra.md), passion and fear.
- From [Leda](../Realms/Leda.md), curiosity and loyalty.
- From [Deracha](../Realms/Deracha.md), will and corruption.
- From [Eromorra](../Realms/Eromorra.md), hope and faith.
