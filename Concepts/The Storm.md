Magic flows through the realms like a storm, a great and enormous, all be it finite, bomb of energy bound in a tiny flask. Ever rotating, twisting and carving the environment. 
Magic is the primary force behind ‘the dormant God’ [[Anvea, The Dormant God|Anvea, The Dormant God]]  some argue that magic is the thoughts of [[Anvea, The Dormant God|Anvea, The Dormant God]] himself. 

If the world was to be compared to a battery, the negative charge would be the realm [[Leda]] and the positive charge [[Hailra]]. Two opposite ends of magic yet both magic all the same.
Those who study magic and attempt to gain knowledge may come to understand the strange magical storm but for most mortals this could never be fully understood.
Some say, true understanding of the magical storm is what will push one into godhood.

Every living being has magic in them, without it they wouldn’t be able to persist. Even the undead are reanimated by magic. 

Like mentioned earlier, the magic of this world is finite, even the God of everything cannot reach into the infinite. At the edges of the world, in the realm of [[Abyra]] magic seems to slow down, wither and spat back out towards the other realms. In the [[Abyra]] everything is lost, even magic. If we use the example of the flask, [[Abyra]] would be the glass outer surface, separating the magic from nothingness
