A God said to calculate the fate of mortals. He creates prophecies and keeps them in his "book of fate's demand", a book he always carries with himself.
Although his calculations and prophecies are rarely wrong, the fact that mortals have free will and true choice very rarely defy fate, causing prophecies to be denied.
