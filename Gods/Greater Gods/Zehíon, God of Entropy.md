# Zehíon, God of Entropy

Zehíon is the unraveling, the gnawing void that erases meaning itself. He does not destroy with violence but with the slow erosion of order, memory, and will. His worshippers often go mad, unable to remember why they prayed to him as their minds dissolve into static. To look upon Zehíon is to feel yourself coming apart, thread by thread, until nothing of you remains.
