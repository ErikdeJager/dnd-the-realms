# Mizohr, God of Abyss

Prime god of the realm [Abyra](../../Realms/Abyra.md), though this god rules the outer edges of the universe itself, even Mizohr cannot leave this realm freely. He can send his avatars outside and is able to communicate with other beings outside the realm of Abyra. Still, Mizohr's power is not to be underestimated; for this god is the only known being that can create portals into and out of Abyra.



Prime god of the realm [Abyra](../../Realms/Abyra.md), Mizohr is the Warden of the Edgeâ€”the keeper of all that lies beyond the dream. It rules the silent frontier where creation ends and nothingness begins.

Even Mizohr cannot freely leave Abyra without consequence, for its essence is bound to the void itself. Yet out of all the gods, Mizohr is the only god known to be able to exit Abyra.
