# Ehria, Goddess of Ash

Goddess of death, endings, and the quiet balance between life and what follows.

Ehria oversees the final passage of all things. Be it mortals that reunite with [the circle](../../Concepts/The%20Circle.md) or gods that reincarnate. To her, death is not cruelty but completion.

Ehria desires death to be fair to all. Therefore she will never abuse her power.
