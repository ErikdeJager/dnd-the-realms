# Imlot, God of Space

God of space, distance, and the silent paths between realms.

Imlot is a quiet and impartial god, content to drift between worlds without judgment or desire. Where others shape or destroy, Imlot merely positionsâ€”ensuring that each realm holds its rightful place within the vastness of creation.

Though often overlooked, without Imlot the realms would collapse in upon themselves. He is the keeper of the in-between, the unseen force that holds space together.
