# Arawen, God of Miasma

Arawen is the choking breath of pestilence, the reeking fog that crawls through battlefields and graveyards. He delights in smothering mortals, watching them gasp as their lungs fill with rot and poison. Wherever his presence lingers, clouds of noxious vapor rise, carrying madness, hallucinations, and slow, agonizing death. His followers spread his gifts by burning corpses in sealed halls, unleashing plagues of foul air upon the living. They wear masks of bone not to protect themselves, but to mock those who choke and die. To worship Arawen is to embrace suffocation—breathing poison until one’s body becomes part of the miasma itself.
