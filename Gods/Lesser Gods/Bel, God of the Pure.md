# Bel, God of the Pure

Bel is the embodiment of clarity and untainted purpose. His worshipers strive to purify themselves of corruption, whether physical, spiritual, or moral. Though his ideals inspire, they can also become oppressive, for Bel demands perfection. His followers often clash with those of more chaotic gods, leading to both holy wars and quiet fanaticism.
