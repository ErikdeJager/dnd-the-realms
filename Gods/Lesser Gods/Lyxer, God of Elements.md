# Lyxer, God of Elements

Lyxer represents the primal forces—fire, water, air, and earth. He is a shifting deity, ever-changing as the elements do. His followers see him as the balance of creation, embodying both destruction and life. Druids and elementalists often seek his blessings before bending nature’s raw power to their will.
