# Ridis, Goddess of Triumph

Ridis embodies victory and perseverance. She blesses mortals who endure great struggles and emerge victorious. Once a mortal hero herself, she ascended to divinity after defying fate and slaying a great threat to the world ([b1412 - The Second God War.md](../../Historic%20Events/b1412%20-%20The%20Second%20God%20War.md)). Her followers are often soldiers and athletes who pray for her strength before great challenges.

But all must meet the circle.
