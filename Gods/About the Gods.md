## About Fallen Gods

Fallen gods are either dead, forgotten or stripped of all powers.
It is, however possible to revive them.

The only way to kill a God is to kill them **and** remove all magic residing in their being. If they are killed and they still have even a small amount of power left they can instantly reincarnate. The most well known method for killing gods is by trapping them in [Abyra.md](../Realms/Abyra.md) and killing them in this realm. The Realm [Abyra.md](../Realms/Abyra.md) will consume all magic in the Gods body upon their death.
Their corpse will remain in limbo until either the universe ends or an external force removes their body and brings it back to one of the living realms.
If a Gods corpse is brought back to another realm it is possible to be revived by pushing magic into the dead Gods body.
