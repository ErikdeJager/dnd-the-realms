# Anvea, The Dormant God

Anvea fell asleep. In its sleep, the dream began—and from that dream, all realms and lives took form.

Anvea does not rule; it dreams, and the dream is the law. The [Rules of the Dream](../../Concepts/Rules%20of%20the%20Dream.md) bind every god, every soul, and every breath within its slumber.

If Anvea were ever to awaken, all things would vanish as the dream unravels. Yet even in sleep, the god stirs—the skies shift, the realms tremble, and creation reshapes itself around a change in the dreamer’s mind.

To exist is to be dreamt by Anvea.
