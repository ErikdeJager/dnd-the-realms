# Erdilluth, God of Rot

“Lord of Rot, Thou who art, who wast, and who yet shalt become.  
Behold, Thou wert before the ancient slumber, and didst win the crown.  
Even in decay and in death, Thou abidest eternal.  
Through the death of all things, and through the poetry of those departed,  
the sole worth of life is found in Thee, who dost unmake death itself.  
For mortals cannot fathom the love of decay, nor the touch of absence.”
